## What do you want the user to feel when using these tools? What mood is this for? What is the user trying to do?

I want the user to have fun when using these tools. The mood this is for is for when people want to have fun drawing. The user is trying to expirement with drawing with brushes and having fun.

## Describe your eraser. What does it do?

My eraser overwrites everything its dragged over and returns the area back to the color of the background, effectively erasing anything you drag it across by returning the area to the original colour it was.

## Describe your 1st tool. What does it do? How is it used?

My first tool is a jagged discrete brush the uses squares as the frame by frame painting, if you drag your mouse slowly you get a jagged rough looking line and if you go fast you can space out the squares.

## Describe your 2nd tool. What does it do? How is it used?

My second tool is a basic regular continuous brush for normal painting so if people want to draw without exotic effects they can use this brush

## Describe your 3rd tool. What does it do? How is it used?

My third tool is my favourite, its this kind of yarn twining motion shape that fills in as you drag the mouse. In general if you consider the form it draws in a sort of cylindrical shape.
And as you draw with it for every continuous drawing motion it continues to fill out and roud out the edges for as long as you draw. If you start and stop you can also keep the "yarny" look.

## Describe your 4th tool. What does it do? How is it used?

My fourth tool seems like a normal brush if a little fancy looking and it can be used like that but if you look closely you can see how it uses curve vertices to make it look fancy and if you draw really fast you can open up the line and get a "yarny" effect similar to the previous brush.

## Which of your tools is continuous? What makes that different?

Tool 2 is continuous, its made different from the rest because each point as you drag is seamlessly connected to the previous making it continuous and no matter how you draw you cant seperate the frames like you can for the other tools

## Which of your tools uses begin/endshape? What are you doing with that feature?

Tool 3 uses begin/endshape. I'm using this feature to establish the seperate shapes for each mouse drag so the brush can do the filling in the yarn motion each time.

## List any resources (code, images, etc) you've used, and where you got them from

Based my code off the starter code from canvas

## List any help you got from classmates or websites, so that you can remember it for later
